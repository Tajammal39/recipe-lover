Testing is crucial to ensure that the app meets all the specified requirements. It involves
monitoring and analyzing the app's output to verify if it aligns with the desired functionality.

### Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for individual components, such as data source classes or utility functions, to
verify their functionality in isolation. Unit tests help catch bugs early and ensure that each
component behaves as intended.

### UI Testing:

UI Testing: Implement UI tests to validate the app's user interface and user interactions. Test
scenarios like scrolling through the recipe list, opening recipe details, saving favorites, and
